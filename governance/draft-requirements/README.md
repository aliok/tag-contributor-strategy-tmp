# Draft CNCF Governance Requirements

This folder contains an assortment of drafts and supporting materials for suggested changes to the CNCF requirements for project governance at the Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated levels.  *None of the policies or requirements in this folder are currently approved or in effect.*  Rather, these are a collection of unapproved changes shared here for discussion by CNCF members and the TOC.

When the TOC periodically reviews the diligence and graduation processes, they will consider whether they desired the changes suggested here. After that happens, documents here will be moved to the TOC project requirements, the Governance docs, or both.  Rejected changes will be moved into a "rejected" subfolder.
